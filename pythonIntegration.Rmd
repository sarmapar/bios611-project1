##Python Integration

For the python integration, I decided to look into if more people visit parks with a higher number of species unique to that US National Park, meaning the only recorded observation of that species is in a single park. There seems to be strong correlation on the diagonal, but there are also quite a few parks that have lower annual visitors but a higher number of unique species, with a r-squared value of 0.347 for linear regression. This is not strong evidence for a correlation between annual visitors and rare species for national parks in the United States.


To create the plot from the makefile, run:
